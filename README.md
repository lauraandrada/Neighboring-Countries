# Neighboring-Countries 🌍

Team project 

Using the data located in the "data.js" file, we created a website which allows to select a country from a drop-down list and get the following information about it: 

🟣 flag image, 
🟣 common name, 
🟣 region, 
🟣 subregion, 
🟣 capital, 
🟣 the neighbour with the largest population, 
🟣 the neighbour with the largest area.

There is also an option to select a translation in multiple available languages.
